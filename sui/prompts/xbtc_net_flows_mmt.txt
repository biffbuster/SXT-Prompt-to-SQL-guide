In the top query, filter sui.events where the type is 0x70285592c97965e811e0c6f98dccc3a9c2b4ad854b3594faab9597ada267b860::liquidity::AddLiquidityEvent and the package_id is 0xc84b1ef2ac2ba5c3018e2b8c956ba5d0391e0e46d1daa1926d5a99a6a42526b4. Join with sui.balance_changes on transaction_block_digest where the coin_type is 0x876a4b7bce8aeaef60464c11f4026903e9afacab79b9b142686158aa86560b50::xbtc::XBTC. Count distinct transactions and senders, and sum the negative amount divided by 1e27 to track XBTC added.

In the bottom query, repeat the same structure but filter for the type 0x70285592c97965e811e0c6f98dccc3a9c2b4ad854b3594faab9597ada267b860::liquidity::RemoveLiquidityEvent. Again, join with sui.balance_changes on transaction_block_digest using the same coin_type, and sum the negative amount divided by 1e27 to track XBTC removed. Group both queries by date and combine them with UNION ALL. Order by date descending and limit the result to 200 rows.
